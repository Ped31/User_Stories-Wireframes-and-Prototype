# User_Stories-Wireframes-and-Prototype

#### Foodie Club App - Frontend
**User Stories:** We have used *Trello* to create our User Stories and the Board. In the Board we have included 5 columns:
- To Do: Main tasks to develop the project.
- Doing: What each member is currently doing.
- Done: Tasks finished already.
- Wishlist: Here we have added extra features to do after the main content is finished.
- In review: Just in case any of the tasks needs to be reviewed.

Prototype: To develop this part we decided to focus on the Create an account/Login pages, the main view of our app, called Home, and the user profile page.
